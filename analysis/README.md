- Entry points stored at fixed ROM offsets: 0x3E4 (Master), 0x3E8 (Slave)
- SH2 Boot ROM reads these addresses on startup
- Handshake protocol confirmed: Master writes "M_OK", Slave writes "S_OK"
- 68K waits for handshake at ROM 0x808, then writes 0 to COMM0/COMM4 to start

## 🚀 Optimization Opportunities

### Identified (Potential)
Once SH2 code is located and analyzed, look for:

1. **Rendering Pipeline**:
   - Polygon sorting algorithms
   - Clipping optimization
   - Fill rate bottlenecks
   - Cache usage patterns

2. **Data Structures**:
   - Polygon mesh organization
   - Vertex transformation caching
   - Display list optimization

3. **Synchronization**:
   - Frame pacing
   - SH2 workload balancing
   - FIFO utilization

4. **Memory Access**:
   - Cache vs uncached regions
   - DMA usage efficiency
   - SDRAM access patterns

**Note**: Cannot proceed with optimization until SH2 code is located and understood.
