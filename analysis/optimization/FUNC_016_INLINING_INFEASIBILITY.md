# func_016 Inlining Feasibility Analysis

**Date**: January 2026
**Status**: ✅ FEASIBLE for func_021 / ⚠️ COMPLEX for func_017-019

> **UPDATE (2026-01-24)**: func_021 was successfully optimized using the expansion ROM
> approach. See [OPTIMIZATION_LESSONS_LEARNED.md](OPTIMIZATION_LESSONS_LEARNED.md) for
> implementation details. The analysis below remains accurate for func_017/018/019.

## Executive Summary

Investigation into inlining func_016 at its 4 call sites revealed:

1. **func_021**: ✅ Successfully optimized using expansion ROM approach (2026-01-24)
2. **func_017, func_018, func_019**: ⚠️ Complex - tightly coupled state machine with shared code paths

The state machine complexity of func_017-019, combined with BSR range limitations, makes traditional inlining impractical for those functions. However, **func_021 is a standalone function** that was successfully relocated to expansion ROM with func_016 inlined.

## Key Discovery: State Machine Architecture

### Code Structure Analysis

The disassembly reveals the callers share a complex control flow:

```
02223386  RTS                        ; func_016 ends
02223388  MOV.L R4,@($34,R14)        ; func_016's delay slot = first caller instruction
0222338A  STS.L PR,@-R15             ; func_017 entry point
0222338C  BSR   $02223368            ; func_017 calls func_016
...
02223394  BF    $022233A4            ; func_017 branches INTO func_018's body
...
022233A0  RTS                        ; func_017 exit
022233A2  NOP                        ; func_017's delay slot = func_018 entry point
```

### Shared Elements

1. **Delay Slot Sharing**
   - func_016's RTS uses delay slot at 0x02223388
   - This instruction is also the first operation of the caller state machine
   - func_017's RTS uses delay slot at 0x022233A2
   - That NOP is also func_018's entry point

2. **Cross-Function Branching**
   - func_017 @ 0x02223394: `BF $022233A4` branches INTO func_018's body
   - func_018/019 share exit path at 0x0222339E
   - Multiple functions converge on common cleanup code

3. **Embedded Data Literals**
   - Literal pools between function segments (0x02223410: `$FF00`, 0x0222344C: `$00FF00FF`)
   - These appear inline within the code stream

## Why Inlining Fails

### Constraint 1: No Clean Entry Points

Creating trampolines at func_017/018/019 entry points would break cross-function branches:
- A trampoline at 0x0222338A would disrupt the branch at 0x02223394
- func_018/019 jump back into func_017's loop (0x02223390)
- Modifying any entry point breaks the state machine

### Constraint 2: BSR Range Limitation

The SH2 BSR instruction has a range of PC ± 4KB (±2048 words):
- func_016 callers are at ~0x0222338A
- Expansion space starts at ~0x02300000
- Distance: ~0x100000 (1MB) - **far exceeds BSR range**

To reach expansion space would require:
```assembly
MOV.L  @(disp,PC),R0    ; 2 bytes, 1 cycle - load expansion address
JMP    @R0              ; 2 bytes, 2 cycles
NOP                     ; 2 bytes, 1 cycle - delay slot
```
This adds 4+ cycles overhead, **negating the 6-cycle savings** from eliminating BSR/RTS.

### Constraint 3: No Slack Space

Inlining func_016 (30 bytes) at each call site would expand code by:
- 30 bytes code - 4 bytes BSR+delay = 26 bytes per site
- 26 bytes × 4 sites = 104 bytes expansion needed

The original ROM has **zero slack bytes** - every byte is used for code or data.

### Constraint 4: Code Density Optimization

The original developers applied extreme code density optimizations:
- Delay slot sharing between unrelated functions
- Branch targets that land mid-function
- State machine patterns spanning multiple "functions"

This is **space-optimized code**, not **speed-optimized code**.

## Attempted Approaches

| Approach | func_021 | func_017-019 | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------------|-------|
| In-place inlining | N/A | FAILED | No room, would overwrite adjacent code |
| Trampoline to expansion | ✅ SUCCESS | FAILED | Works for standalone functions only |
| Caller relocation to expansion | ✅ SUCCESS | FAILED | Cross-function branches break for 017-019 |
| Full block relocation | N/A | TOO RISKY | Would require replicating complex state machine |

**Key insight**: func_021 succeeded because it's a **standalone function** without the cross-function dependencies of func_017-019.

## Recommendations

### Completed ✅
1. **func_021 optimization**: Successfully implemented with expansion ROM approach
   - Saves ~4,800 cycles/frame (1 of 4 call sites)
   - See `disasm/sh2/expansion/func_021_optimized.asm`

### Short Term
1. **Apply same pattern** to other standalone hot functions
2. **Profile actual FPS gain** from func_021 optimization
3. **Document expansion ROM patterns** for future use

### Long Term (for func_017-019)
If optimizing the remaining 3 call sites is a priority:
1. **Full rewrite** of func_017-019 complex as a single optimized unit
2. **Relocate entire state machine block** to expansion space
3. **Replicate all cross-function branches** in expansion code
4. **Extensive testing** required due to complexity

This would be a major undertaking requiring deep understanding of the polygon processing state machine, but the func_021 POC proves the approach is viable.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Hand-optimized assembly is fragile**: The original code trades maintainability for space
2. **Function boundaries are illusions**: Call graph analysis can't reveal shared code paths
3. **Range limitations matter**: SH2's limited branch range constrains optimization options
4. **Space vs speed tradeoff**: Original game chose space, limiting our speed options
5. **Standalone functions CAN be optimized**: func_021 proved the expansion ROM approach works
6. **Trampoline overhead is acceptable**: 4-6 cycle overhead is offset by 6+ cycle savings from inlining
7. **4-byte alignment is critical**: MOV.L @(disp,PC) requires aligned literal pools
8. **Verify instruction encoding**: Comments in disassembly may be wrong - always check opcodes
