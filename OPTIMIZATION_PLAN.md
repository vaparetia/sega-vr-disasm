# Virtua Racing 32X - Optimization Strategy

**Status:** Revised strategic plan (v5.0 update)
**Last Updated:** February 7, 2026
**Baseline:** ~20-24 FPS (measured, scene-dependent)
**Target:** 60 FPS (+150%)
**Approach:** Data-driven, 68K-bottleneck-first

---

## Executive Summary

### Ground Truth: The 68K Is THE Bottleneck

Profiling (January 2026) conclusively proved that **the 68000 CPU is the performance constraint**, not SH2 processing time. This finding invalidates the original optimization plan's priorities and fundamentally changes the strategy.

**Evidence:**
1. 68K runs at **100.1% utilization** (127,987 cycles/frame @ 7.67 MHz) — completely saturated
2. Eliminating **66.6% of Slave SH2 work** produced **ZERO FPS improvement** — frame rate unchanged
3. The ~20-24 FPS ceiling is caused by a **blocking command-handshake architecture** that serializes the rendering pipeline through the 68K

**Implication:** Any optimization that doesn't free 68K cycles will NOT improve FPS, regardless of how much SH2 capacity it frees.

### Revised Priority Order

| Priority | Track | Strategy | Expected Gain | Why |
|----------|-------|----------|---------------|-----|
| **1** | **68K Blocking Relief** | Async commands via SH2 interrupt queue | **+46-67% FPS** | Eliminates 68K wait cycles |
| **2** | **Command Batching** | Reduce 35 submissions/frame to ~3 | **+10-20% FPS** | Fewer sync round-trips |
| **3** | **Pipeline Overlap** | 68K builds frame N+1 while SH2 renders N | **+15-30% FPS** | Removes frame serialization |
| **4** | **68K Work Offload** | Move physics/trig to idle Master SH2 | **+5-15% FPS** | Frees 68K compute cycles |
| **5** | **VDP Polling** | Interrupt-driven VDP access (SH2 side) | **Variable** | Only helps if VDP waits are SH2-bound |
| **6** | **SH2 Micro-Opts** | func_016 inlining, MAC loops, FIFO batch | **0% FPS** | SH2 is NOT the bottleneck |

**Combined potential:** 24 FPS → 48-60+ FPS (via Tracks 1-4)

### Key Lesson: SH2 Optimizations Alone Cannot Improve FPS

The v4.0 Slave CPU activation infrastructure is **complete and valuable** — but it must be understood as **capacity preparation**, not a direct FPS improvement. The idle Master SH2 (0% utilization with hooks disabled, 36% with hooks enabled) is the ideal location for the Track 1 interrupt queue that WILL free 68K cycles.

## Current State Analysis

### CPU Utilization (Measured January 29, 2026)

Two profiling configurations have been measured:

**Baseline (expansion hooks DISABLED):**

| CPU | Cycles/Frame | Utilization | Role |
|-----|-------------|-------------|------|
| **68000** | **127,987** | **100.1%** | **BOTTLENECK — orchestrates entire pipeline** |
| Master SH2 | 60 | 0.0% | Completely idle (expansion hooks off) |
| Slave SH2 | 306,989 | 80.1% | All 3D rendering (but 66.5% wasted in idle loop) |

**With expansion hooks ENABLED:**

| CPU | Cycles/Frame | Utilization | Useful Work |
|-----|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **68000** | **127,987** | **100.1%** | **BOTTLENECK** |
| Master SH2 | 139,568 | 36.4% | Vertex transform offload |
| Slave SH2 | 299,958 | 78.3% | 3D rendering (33.5% useful, 66.5% idle loop) |

**Key insight:** 68K utilization is identical in both configurations. Changing SH2 work distribution has zero effect on frame rate.

### Frame Time Budget

```
68K frame budget:   127,833 cycles @ 7.67 MHz = 16.67 ms
SH2 frame budget:   383,500 cycles @ 23.01 MHz = 16.67 ms

Actual frame time breakdown (measured):
  68K game logic + sync:   16.69 ms (100.1% — saturated)
  68K blocking waits:      ~10 ms   (~60% of 68K time!)
  SH2 rendering:           13.04 ms (78.3% utilization)
  Frame overhead:           ~2 ms

Effective FPS:  ~24 FPS (1000ms / 42ms total)
```

### The Blocking Pipeline (Root Cause)

The 68K submits **~35 blocking commands per frame** to the SH2 subsystem:

| Function | Address | Calls/Frame | Blocking Loops | Impact |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| `sh2_cmd_27` | $00E3B4 | 21 | 2 inline loops each | **Dominant — 60% of submissions** |
| `sh2_graphics_cmd` | $00E22C | 14 | 1 via `sh2_send_cmd_wait` | Moderately expensive |
| `sh2_send_cmd_wait` | $00E316 | (indirect) | 1 blocking poll | Used by `sh2_graphics_cmd` |
| `sh2_wait_response` | $00E342 | (indirect) | Polls COMM6 | Final sync per command |

Each command follows a strict `submit → wait → continue` pattern:

```
68K                              SH2
 |                                |
 |-- Write COMM0 (command) -----> |
 |-- Write COMM4+5 (params) ----> |
 |                                |
 |   ┌── BLOCKING WAIT ──┐       |-- Process command
 |   │  Poll COMM6        │       |
 |   │  (wastes 68K cycles)│      |
 |   └────────────────────┘       |
 |                                |-- Write COMM6 (done)
 |<-- Read COMM6 (acknowledged) --|
 |                                |
 |-- Next command...              |
```

**~60% of 68K cycles are wasted polling COMM registers.** This is the performance ceiling.

## Completed Work

### v4.0 Parallel Processing Infrastructure (January 2026)

**Status:** COMPLETE but NOT ACTIVATED

| Component | Address | Size | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|------|---------|
| `handler_frame_sync` | $300028 | 22B | Frame synchronization |
| `master_dispatch_hook` | $300050 | 44B | Skips COMM7 for cmd $16 |
| `func_021_optimized` | $300100 | 96B | Vertex transform (func_016 inlined) |
| `slave_work_wrapper` | $300200 | 76B | Command dispatch |
| `slave_test_func` | $300280 | 44B | Test harness |
| `batch_copy_handler` | $300500 | — | Batch copy command handler |
| `cmd27_queue_drain` | $300600 | — | Queue drain for cmd $27 |

**Expansion ROM:** 1MB at $300000-$3FFFFF, only ~1KB used (~99.9% free)

**Activation requires:** Patching dispatch at $02046A and trampoline at $0234C8.

### v5.0 68K Modularization (February 2026)

- **693 68K functions** modularized across 12 sections (79,940 bytes)
- **571 modules** auto-translated to proper assembly mnemonics (82.5%)
- **75 SH2 functions** integrated into build system
- **17 module categories:** boot, data, display, frame, game, graphics, hardware-regs, input, main-loop, math, memory, object, sh2, sound, util, vdp, vint
- All translations verified byte-identical to original ROM

### 68K Async Attempt (January 2026) — FAILED

**What happened:** Implemented `sh2_send_cmd_async` and async queue logic in 68K section.

**Why it failed:** Section `$00E200-$010200` has **ZERO bytes free**. Without initialization code, Work RAM contains garbage → ROM freezes on boot.

**Removed in:** Commit `0dd98c4`

**Lesson:** 68K-side async is impossible in the current ROM layout. The solution must live on the SH2 side.

### Delay Loop Elimination Experiment (January 2026) — SUCCEEDED (but no FPS gain)

**What happened:** Reduced Slave SH2 idle delay loop from 64 to 1 iteration.

**Result:** Slave cycles dropped 66.6% (299,958 → 100,157), FPS **unchanged**.

**Value:** Proved the 68K bottleneck hypothesis beyond doubt. Also demonstrated profiler accuracy (±4% variance from predictions).

---

## Optimization Tracks

### Track 1: 68K Blocking Relief — Async Commands 🔥🔥🔥 CRITICAL

**Goal:** Eliminate ~60% of 68K time spent polling COMM registers
**Expected gain:** +46-67% FPS (24 → 35-40 FPS)
**Risk:** Medium (requires careful synchronization)

#### The Problem

The 68K spends **~10ms per frame** (60% of its budget) blocked in polling loops waiting for SH2 acknowledgment. Every one of the ~35 graphics commands per frame requires a full round-trip handshake.

#### The Solution: SH2 Interrupt Queue (Path B)

Since the 68K section has no space for async infrastructure, the completely idle **Master SH2** will manage the command queue instead.

**Decision Matrix (from SH2_ASYNC_QUEUE_ANALYSIS.md):**

| Factor | 68K Queue | SH2 Queue | Winner |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Implementation space | 0 bytes free | 1MB expansion ROM | **SH2** |
| Queue management CPU | 68K (saturated) | Master SH2 (idle) | **SH2** |
| Command latency | Direct COMM write | CMDINT → Master → Slave | 68K |
| Complexity | Simple | Medium | 68K |
| **Overall Score** | **2.3/5** | **4.0/5** | **SH2** |

#### Architecture

```
68K                    Master SH2              Slave SH2
 |                     (currently idle)         (3D rendering)
 |                         |                       |
 |-- Write cmd to queue -->|                       |
 |   (SDRAM ring buffer)   |                       |
 |                         |                       |
 |-- Fire CMDINT --------->|                       |
 |   (returns immediately) |                       |
 |                         |-- Dequeue command      |
 |-- Continue game logic   |-- Write COMM0/4/6     |
 |   (no blocking!)        |-- Signal Slave ------->|
 |                         |                       |-- Process command
 |                         |<-- COMM6 done --------|
 |                         |-- Dequeue next...      |
```

**Key benefit:** 68K writes command to SDRAM and fires CMDINT — **zero polling, immediate return**. The Master SH2 handles all COMM register choreography.

#### COMM Register Collision Analysis

All 17 command submissions per frame reuse COMM0/COMM4/COMM6. Naive async would corrupt parameters mid-transfer. The solution:

- **Single-slot pending queue:** Only one command in flight at a time
- **Master SH2 serializes:** Ensures COMM registers are stable before next submission
- **15 of 17 call sites are safe** for async conversion
- **2 call sites** ($010B2C, $010BAE) have secondary blocking on RAM flag `$FFFFC80E` — need special handling

#### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Master SH2 Queue Infrastructure** (Expansion ROM)
1. Ring buffer in SDRAM (64 commands × 8 bytes = 512 bytes at $2203F000)
2. CMDINT handler on Master SH2 (dequeue + COMM register write)
3. 68K-side `sh2_send_cmd_async` shim (write to buffer + trigger CMDINT)
4. Frame boundary sync (`sh2_wait_frame_complete`)

**Phase 2: Convert sh2_cmd_27** (21 calls/frame — biggest win)
1. Replace inline blocking loops with async shim calls
2. Test with profiler — expect ~40% 68K cycle reduction for these calls
3. Validate rendering correctness

**Phase 3: Convert sh2_graphics_cmd** (14 calls/frame)
1. Replace `sh2_send_cmd_wait` path with async
2. Handle the 2 unsafe call sites (secondary RAM flag blocking)
3. Full-frame async: all 35 commands non-blocking

**Phase 4: Pipeline frame sync**
1. Move frame completion check to dedicated sync point
2. Ensure Slave finishes before buffer flip
3. Measure total FPS gain

#### Sizing

The 68K async shim needs to fit in the cramped `$00E200` section. Minimum footprint:

| Component | Location | Size |
|-----------|----------|------|
| `sh2_send_cmd_async` shim | $00E200 section | ~20 bytes |
| Ring buffer | SDRAM $2203F000 | 512 bytes |
| CMDINT handler | Expansion ROM $300700 | ~128 bytes |
| Queue drain logic | Expansion ROM $300800 | ~128 bytes |
| Frame sync | Expansion ROM $300900 | ~64 bytes |

**Blocker:** The 68K section has 0 bytes free. Options:
1. Find dead code to reclaim (most promising — analyze all 68K modules for unreachable paths)
2. Shorten existing code (compress adjacent functions by 20 bytes)
3. Move the shim to a different 68K section with space
4. Use a BSR trampoline to a free area elsewhere

### Track 2: Command Batching 🔥🔥 HIGH

**Goal:** Reduce 35 individual command submissions to ~3 batch operations per frame
**Expected gain:** +10-20% FPS (stacks with Track 1)
**Risk:** Low-Medium

#### The Problem

Even with async submission, each command still requires COMM register setup and handshake. Reducing the total number of submissions reduces per-command overhead.

#### Batch Copy Command ($26)

A specific opportunity: 8 sequential `sh2_send_cmd_wait` calls in the copy routine can be replaced with a single batch command.

**Design (from BATCH_COPY_COMMAND_DESIGN.md):**
1. 68K writes command list to SDRAM (8 × 8 bytes = 64 bytes)
2. 68K sends single batch command $26 with pointer to list
3. SH2 processes all 8 commands sequentially
4. Single COMM6 acknowledgment when all complete

**Expected reduction:** 75-87.5% fewer blocking calls for this sequence.

**SH2 handler:** `batch_copy_handler` at $300500 (already in expansion ROM layout).

#### Broader Batching Opportunities

| Batch Group | Commands | Current Calls | Batched Calls | Reduction |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| Copy sequence | $22-type | 8 | 1 | 87.5% |
| cmd_27 burst | $27-type | 21 | 1-3 | 86-95% |
| Graphics init | Mixed | 6 | 1 | 83% |
| **Total** | — | **35** | **~3-5** | **~86-91%** |

---

### Track 3: Pipeline Overlap 🔥🔥 HIGH

**Goal:** Allow 68K to build frame N+1 commands while SH2 renders frame N
**Expected gain:** +15-30% FPS (requires Tracks 1-2 first)
**Risk:** Medium-High (frame coherency concerns)

#### The Problem

Currently, the 68K and SH2 operate in **strict lockstep**: the 68K cannot prepare the next frame's data until the SH2 finishes the current frame. This serializes the entire pipeline.

#### The Solution: Double-Buffered Command Lists

```
Frame N:     68K prepares → SH2 renders → complete
Frame N+1:                  68K prepares → SH2 renders → complete

With pipelining:
Frame N:     68K prepares → SH2 renders ────────────→ complete
Frame N+1:                  68K prepares → SH2 renders → complete
                            ↑ overlap ↑
```

**Implementation:**
1. Two command buffers in SDRAM (A and B)
2. 68K writes to buffer A while SH2 processes buffer B
3. Swap at frame boundary
4. Requires careful synchronization to prevent data races

**Prerequisite:** Track 1 (async commands) must be working first, since the 68K can't overlap if it's still blocking on each command.

---

### Track 4: 68K Work Offload 🔥 MEDIUM

**Goal:** Move non-rendering 68K computation to the idle Master SH2
**Expected gain:** +5-15% FPS
**Risk:** Medium (data coherency between CPUs)

#### The Opportunity

The Master SH2 is either completely idle (0% with hooks off) or lightly loaded (36% with hooks on). Meanwhile the 68K is 100% saturated. Offloading pure computation frees 68K cycles.

**Candidates for offload:**
1. **Trigonometric lookups** — 68K math functions that could run on SH2
2. **Object sorting/culling** — Pre-processing before command submission
3. **Physics integration** — Position/velocity updates
4. **Collision detection** — Bounding box tests

**Data flow:** 68K writes inputs to shared SDRAM → signals Master SH2 → Master SH2 computes → writes results back → 68K reads results.

**Constraint:** Cache-through addressing (`0x2203xxxx`) required for all shared data to prevent stale cache reads.

---

### Track 5: VDP Polling Elimination ⬇️ MEDIUM-LOW

**Goal:** Replace SH2-side busy-wait VDP polling with interrupt-driven access
**Expected gain:** Variable (only helps if SH2 becomes the bottleneck after Tracks 1-4)
**Risk:** Medium (SH2 interrupt hardware bug requires workaround)

#### Context Shift

The original plan listed this as the #1 priority based on the assumption that SH2 VDP polling (~450K cycles) was the primary bottleneck. **Profiling disproved this.** The VDP polling loops are on the SH2 side, and the SH2 is NOT the constraint — the 68K is.

**However:** Once Tracks 1-4 free enough 68K cycles, the SH2 may become the bottleneck again. At that point, VDP polling elimination becomes relevant.

#### SH2 Interrupt Hardware Bug (Still Applies)

The original SH2 silicon has a documented interrupt bug (see [32x-hardware-manual-supplement-2.md](docs/32x-hardware-manual-supplement-2.md)). Any interrupt-driven approach must implement:

1. **FRT TOCR toggle** in every interrupt handler (corrective action for hardware bug)
2. **Only use interrupt levels** 14, 12, 10, 8, 6 (other levels reserved/restricted)
3. **Shared interrupt dispatcher** — all external interrupts route through one handler
4. **2+ cycle wait** after interrupt clear before RTE
5. **DMA restrictions** — no VDP access in H-interrupt during DMA

See the original plan's Track 1 section for the complete corrective action code template.

#### VDP Polling Locations (SH2 side)

| SH2 Address | Wait Condition | Frequency |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| $0243E2 | V-blank | 1/frame |
| $02441E | H-blank | Variable |
| $02443A | FIFO ready | Per polygon |
| $024482 | Frame buffer swap | 1/frame |

---

### Track 6: SH2 Micro-Optimizations ⬇️ LOW

**Goal:** Optimize individual SH2 functions for fewer cycles
**Expected FPS gain:** 0% (SH2 is not the bottleneck)
**Value:** Capacity improvement — frees SH2 headroom for additional workload

#### Why Track 6 is Low Priority

Profiling proved that SH2 cycle reduction does NOT improve FPS:
- Eliminating 66.6% of Slave work (200K cycles) → 0% FPS change
- The delay loop experiment is definitive proof

**However**, these optimizations create SH2 headroom that enables Tracks 3-4 (more work for SH2 means it must be efficient enough to handle it).

#### Known Opportunities

| Optimization | Target | Cycle Savings | Status |
|-------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| func_016 inlining | func_021 call chain | ~10% of vertex transform | ✅ Done in expansion ROM |
| MAC loop unrolling | Matrix multiply | ~15% of multiply | Designed, not implemented |
| Frame buffer FIFO batching | Rasterizer | 2.4x pixel write speed | Needs profiling |
| SDRAM 16-byte alignment | Data structures | Burst read improvement | Needs profiling |
| Delay loop reduction | Slave idle loop | 66.6% Slave reduction | ✅ Proven (no FPS gain) |

#### Frame Buffer FIFO Detail (Hardware)

The 32X frame buffer has a 4-word write FIFO:
- Single write: 3 clock cycles/word
- Burst write (4+ consecutive words): 5 cycles total = **1.25 cycles/word**
- **Potential speedup: 2.4x** for frame buffer writes

**Action:** Profile whether VRD already uses 4-word burst writes. If not, restructuring the rasterizer to write in 4-word bursts could significantly reduce rendering time.

## Hardware Hazards and Constraints

### RV Bit — SH2 ROM Access Blocking

**Risk:** When RV=1 (ROM-to-VRAM DMA in progress), **ALL SH2 ROM access stalls** until 68000 clears it.

**Impact on expansion ROM:** Functions at $02300000+ would stall during any 68K ROM→VRAM DMA transfer.

**Mitigation:** If RV=1 occurs during gameplay, critical expansion code must be copied to SDRAM ($06xxxxxx) which is not affected by RV.

**Status:** Not yet profiled. Priority investigation item.

### FM Bit — VDP Access Preemption

**Risk:** Writing FM=1 **immediately preempts** any ongoing 68K VDP access, even mid-transfer. Can cause VRAM/CRAM/VSRAM corruption.

**Mitigation:** Only switch FM during V-Blank when VDP is idle.

### COMM Register Race Conditions

**Risk:** Simultaneous writes from 68K and SH2 to the same COMM register produce undefined values.

**Current usage:**
- COMM7 ($2000402E): Master→Slave signal — unidirectional (safe)
- COMM5 ($2000402A): Vertex transform counter — verify write direction

**Rule for async design:** Master SH2 queue must ensure 68K never writes COMM0/4/6 simultaneously with SH2 reads of those registers.

### CMDINT Behavioral Difference

Unlike VINT/HINT/PWMINT, the CMD interrupt is **negated when masked** and **re-asserted when unmasked** if the condition still exists. This affects the Master SH2 queue design:
- CMDINT can be used as a reliable trigger for queue processing
- No risk of lost interrupts (level-triggered behavior)
- Must still clear via CMD Clear register ($2000401A)

2. Identify remaining bottleneck (68K? SH2? VDP?)
3. If SH2-bound: activate Track 5 (VDP polling elimination)
4. If 68K-bound: activate Track 4 (work offload)
5. Fine-tune and optimize

## Risk Analysis

### Track 1 Risks (Async Commands)

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| COMM register corruption from async writes | High | Single-slot queue, Master SH2 serializes |
| 68K section has 0 bytes for async shim | High | Dead code reclamation or BSR trampoline |
| CMDINT timing issues | Medium | CMDINT is level-triggered, reliable |
| Master SH2 queue overhead exceeds savings | Low | Master is 0% utilized, has massive headroom |

### Track 2 Risks (Batching)

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Batch order matters for rendering | Medium | Preserve original command ordering |
| SDRAM bandwidth contention | Low | Batch reads are burst-friendly |

### Track 3 Risks (Pipeline Overlap)

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Frame N+1 reads stale frame N data | High | Double-buffer all shared state |
| Increased memory usage for double buffers | Medium | SDRAM has headroom |
| Input latency increase (+1 frame) | Low | Acceptable trade-off for 2x FPS |

### General Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| RV bit blocks expansion ROM access | Medium | Copy critical code to SDRAM if needed |
| FM bit preemption corrupts VDP state | Medium | Only switch FM during V-Blank |
| SH2 interrupt hardware bug | Medium | FRT TOCR toggle workaround (documented) |

## Abandoned Approaches

### 1. SH2-Only Optimization for FPS (Proven Ineffective)

**Evidence:** 66.6% Slave SH2 reduction → 0% FPS change. The 68K is the constraint.

**Implication:** func_016 inlining, delay loop elimination, MAC loop unrolling — all valuable for headroom but cannot improve FPS alone.

### 2. 68K In-Section Async (Space Impossible)

**Evidence:** Section `$00E200-$010200` has 0 bytes free. Removed in commit `0dd98c4`.

**Alternative:** SH2 interrupt queue (Path B) — uses expansion ROM with 1MB free.

### 3. func_065 FIFO Batching (Fall-Through Design)

**Evidence:** Function uses fall-through control flow (no RTS). Cannot be restructured without breaking all callers.

### 4. func_017-019 Optimization (Tightly Coupled)

**Evidence:** Shared code paths, cross-function branching, BSR range limits. Cannot be optimized in isolation.

### 5. Code Injection via ROM Patcher (Alignment Limits)

**Evidence:** Reached space/alignment constraints. Replaced by full disassembly/reassembly approach (current v5.0).

## Investigation Priorities

Items requiring empirical measurement before implementation:

1. **RV bit during gameplay** — Does 68K ever set RV=1 during active rendering? If yes, expansion ROM code stalls.
2. **68K dead code in $00E200 section** — Can we reclaim 20+ bytes for the async shim?
3. **Frame buffer FIFO burst patterns** — Does VRD already use 4-word bursts? If not, 2.4x rasterizer speedup available.
4. **SDRAM 16-byte alignment impact** — Do aligned data structures measurably improve burst reads?
5. **68K PC-level hotspots** — Which specific 68K addresses consume the most cycles? (guides work offload)
