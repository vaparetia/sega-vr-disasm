# Virtua Racing 32X - Optimization Strategy

**Status:** Strategic plan approved
**Baseline:** 24 FPS (current measured performance)
**Target:** 60 FPS (+150%)
**Approach:** Data-driven, systematic, high-impact parallelization

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive codebase analysis, we've identified three high-impact optimization tracks:

1. **VDP Polling Elimination** → +30-40% FPS (medium risk)
2. **Slave CPU Activation** → +50-100% FPS (medium risk)
3. **68000 Sync Optimization** → +10-15% FPS (low risk)

**Combined potential:** 24 FPS → 48-72 FPS

**Critical learning:** func_065 FIFO batching is impossible (fall-through design). We've documented this failure and will not pursue it.

### v4.0 Parallel Processing Update (2026-01-26)

**Major Development:** Slave CPU activation infrastructure (v4.0) is **COMPLETE** but **NOT YET ACTIVATED**.

**What's Ready:**
- ✅ Parameter capture trampoline at $0234C8 (func_021)
- ✅ Shared memory parameter block at $2203E000 (SDRAM)
- ✅ Master dispatch hook at $300050 (skips work for COMM7=$16)
- ✅ Slave work dispatcher at $300200 (command routing)
- ✅ func_021_optimized at $300100 (vertex transform with func_016 inlined)
- ✅ 4MB ROM builds successfully with 1MB expansion space ($300000-$3FFFFF)

**Current Blockers:**
1. ❌ PicoDrive latest build broken (no profiling/debugging capability)
2. ❌ Need safe trampolining mechanism to 4th MB expansion ROM (SH2-only)
3. ⚠️ Timing validation required before live activation (frame sync concerns)

**Next Steps:**
→ See [ROADMAP_v4.1.md](analysis/optimization/ROADMAP_v4.1.md) for detailed activation plan

**Impact on Track 2 (Slave CPU Activation):**
- Infrastructure complete (Phases 1-3 of original plan done)
- Activation deferred pending profiling capability and timing validation
- Expected FPS gain remains +50-100% once activated

## Optimization Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. ✅ **Profile before coding** - Use GDB to get empirical data
2. ✅ **Understand before optimizing** - Document function purpose first
3. ✅ **Test incrementally** - One change at a time, verify each step
4. ✅ **Focus on big wins** - 80/20 rule: 20% effort for 80% gain
5. ✅ **Document failures** - Learn from what doesn't work

### Risk Assessment Framework

**Low Risk:**
- Changes to non-timing-critical code
- Well-understood functions
- Easy to revert
- **Example:** 68000 sync optimization

**Medium Risk:**
- Architectural changes (interrupts vs polling)
- Multi-CPU coordination
- Hardware timing changes
- **Example:** VDP interrupt-driven, Slave CPU activation

**High Risk:**
- Modifying fall-through functions
- Cache-sensitive code
- Initialization sequence changes
- **Example:** func_065 (abandoned)

### Success Criteria

**Must have:**
- ROM boots successfully
- Gameplay is playable
- Graphics render correctly
- FPS measured improvement

**Nice to have:**
- Equivalent or better visual quality
- No introduced bugs
- Maintainable code

---

## Optimization Tracks

### Track 1: VDP Polling Elimination 🔥 **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Goal:** Replace busy-wait polling with interrupt-driven VDP access

**Current state:**
- 4 polling loops waste ~450K cycles/frame (47% of budget!)
- Locations: 0x243E2, 0x2441E, 0x2443A, 0x24482
- Waiting for: V-blank, H-blank, FIFO ready, etc.

**Expected gain:** +30-40% FPS (24 → 31-34 FPS)

**Risk:** Medium (hardware timing changes, **requires SH2 interrupt bug workaround**)

#### SH2 Interrupt Hardware Bug (CRITICAL)

**Why VRD uses polling:** The original SH2 silicon has a documented interrupt bug. See [32x-hardware-manual-supplement-2.md](docs/32x-hardware-manual-supplement-2.md).

**Bug symptoms:**
1. External interrupts (V, H, CMD, PWM) can be missed during acknowledge period
2. Wrong interrupt vector may be taken when multiple interrupts arrive simultaneously

**Required corrective action** (if we implement interrupt-driven rendering):
```asm
vint:
    stc.l   gbr, @-r15
    mov.l   #_sysreg, r0
    ldc     r0, gbr
    mov.l   #h'f0, r0           ; Set interrupt mask
    ldc     r0, sr

    ; FRT TOCR toggle (CRITICAL - fixes hardware bug)
    mov.l   #_FRT, r1           ; h'fffffe10
    mov.b   @ (_TOCR, r1), r0   ; Read TOCR (offset h'07)
    xor     #h'02, r0           ; Toggle bit 1
    mov.b   r0, @ (_TOCR, r1)   ; Write back

    mov.w   r0, @ (vintclr, gbr); Clear interrupt

    ; ... (5+ cycles of processing required before RTE) ...

    ldc.l   @r15+, gbr
    rts
    nop
```

**Additional requirements (Hardware Manual §1.15):**

1. **Interrupt Levels**: Only use levels 14, 12, 10, 8, 6
   - DO NOT use levels 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, or 1 (reserved/restricted)
   - V interrupt: Level 12 (NOT 15 as might be expected)
   - H interrupt: Level 10
   - CMD interrupt: Level 8
   - PWM interrupt: Level 6

2. **FRT Configuration** (mandatory initial settings):
   ```
   TIER  = 01h    ; Timer interrupt enable register
   OCRA  = 0002h  ; Output compare register A
   FCTST = 01h    ; Free run timer control/status register
   TOCR  = E2h    ; Timer control register
   ```

3. **Shared Interrupt Vectors**:
   - All external interrupts must jump to same dispatcher routine
   - Dispatcher branches based on SR status register values
   - Cannot use separate handlers for each interrupt level

4. **RTE Timing**:
   - Wait 2+ cycles after clearing interrupt before executing RTE
   - SR mask level ≥ 1 (never 0)
   - Synchronization read-back before RTE to ensure write completion

5. **DMA Restrictions**:
   - Cannot access VDP in H interrupt during DMA operations
   - Must mask both Master and Slave interrupts during auto-request DMA

**Note:** Bug was fixed in EVA chip cut 2.5, but retail 32X units have earlier silicon. These restrictions apply to all production hardware.

## Risk Mitigation

### Known Risks (Updated 2026-01-26)

**v4.0 Activation (Current Blockers):**
- **Risk 1:** PicoDrive debugger broken, no profiling capability
  - **Mitigation:** Investigate SH2 core issue, evaluate MAME or alternative profiling
  - **Fallback:** Cycle-accurate logging in ROM code
- **Risk 2:** Trampolining to 4th MB expansion ROM
  - **Mitigation:** Design safe calling convention, test thoroughly
  - **Fallback:** Keep code in main ROM (limits future expansion)
- **Risk 3:** Slave execution time exceeds frame budget
  - **Mitigation:** Extensive timing validation before activation
  - **Fallback:** Deactivate parallel processing, optimize Slave code

**VDP Interrupts (Track 1):**
- **Risk:** Timing-sensitive, might break rendering
- **Mitigation:** Incremental conversion, one loop at a time
- **Fallback:** Keep polling as backup code path

**Slave CPU Synchronization (Track 2):**
- **Risk:** Race conditions, data corruption
- **Mitigation:** Simple completion flag protocol, extensive testing
- **Fallback:** Disable Slave work queue, revert to Master-only

**68000 Sync (Track 3):**
- **Risk:** Breaking existing communication protocol
- **Mitigation:** Profile first, change incrementally
- **Fallback:** Restore original COMM usage

### Testing Strategy

**For each change:**
1. Compile and verify ROM builds
2. Boot test (does it start?)
3. Visual test (graphics correct?)
4. Gameplay test (playable for 5+ minutes?)
5. FPS measurement (actual improvement?)
6. Regression test (no new bugs?)

**Test ROMs:**
- Keep working baseline ROM
- Create test ROM per change
- Compare side-by-side

## Next Actions (Immediate) - Updated 2026-01-26

### Completed (v4.0 Development)
1. ✅ Create optimization plan (this document)
2. ✅ Find Slave CPU entry point
3. ✅ Analyze Master↔Slave communication
4. ✅ Design and implement parallel processing infrastructure
5. ✅ Document v4.0 architecture

### Current Priority: v4.0 Activation (See ROADMAP_v4.1.md)

**Phase 1: Restore Profiling Capability** ⏳ **IN PROGRESS**
1. Test PicoDrive builds (system vs latest custom)
2. Document exact failure mode
3. Research MAME SH2 core documentation
4. Evaluate alternative profiling approaches
5. Choose profiling strategy

**Phase 2: Safe Trampolining to 4th MB**
1. Design trampoline architecture
2. Implement trampoline infrastructure
3. Migrate v4.0 code to expansion ROM
4. Test call chain (main ROM → expansion ROM)

**Phase 3: Timing Validation**
1. Measure Slave execution time (func_021_optimized)
2. Validate frame budget compliance
3. Implement synchronization protocol
4. Test parameter passing integrity

**Phase 4: Live Activation**

- 68000 sync optimization (Track 3) - lower priority than v4.0
- Additional function parallelization (v4.1+) - depends on v4.0 results

---

## Approval & Commitment (Updated 2026-01-26)

**Original Timeline:** 4 weeks → **REVISED:** 8-12 weeks (v4.0 activation + optimization)

**Phase Breakdown:**
- **Weeks 1-2:** Restore profiling capability
- **Weeks 3-4:** Implement safe trampolining to expansion ROM
- **Weeks 5-6:** Timing validation & synchronization
- **Weeks 7-8:** v4.0 live activation & measurement
- **Weeks 9-12:** Optimization iterations (VDP, 68K sync, load balancing)

**Expected outcome:**
- **v4.0 alone:** 36-48 FPS (+50-100%) - Slave CPU parallel processing
- **Combined:** 60+ FPS (+150%+) - All tracks optimized

**Risk level:** Medium (v4.0 infrastructure complete, activation risks managed)

**Fallback plan:**
- Keep v3.0 baseline ROM at all times
- v4.0 infrastructure can be deactivated if timing validation fails
- Multiple profiling options if PicoDrive unfixable

**Decision points:**
- **Week 2 end:** Profiling capability restored (GO/NO-GO on v4.0 activation)
- **Week 4 end:** Trampolining working (GO/NO-GO on expansion ROM migration)
- **Week 6 end:** Timing validated (GO/NO-GO on live activation)
- **Week 8 end:** v4.0 FPS measured (decide on additional tracks)
- **Week 12 end:** Final optimization assessment

**Current Focus:** v4.0 activation per [ROADMAP_v4.1.md](ROADMAP_v4.1.md)

**This plan reflects v4.0 completion and current activation priorities.** ✅

---

**Next step:** Investigate PicoDrive SH2 core issue and restore profiling capability (ROADMAP Phase 1).
