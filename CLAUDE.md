Agent briefing for Virtua Racing Deluxe 32X disassembly/reassembly project.

**Last Updated**: March 18, 2026

## Agent Team (v4 — VR60)

Two agents, redesigned for the VR60 architectural overhaul. See [agents/README.md](agents/README.md) for details.

**Worker** (Opus default) does all technical work: 68K→SH2 porting, SDRAM integration, build, test. Opus is the default because ALL VR60 work touches SH2/COMM/expansion. Spawn directly — no intermediary.

**Auditor** (Opus) is a safety reviewer with an expanded VR60 checklist: COMM safety + SDRAM addressing + bus contention + cache-through + double-buffer races + entity field preservation + ROM table translation. Spawned fresh per proposal. APPROVED or BLOCKED.

**You are the task manager.** Pick a phase from [VR60_ROADMAP.md](VR60_ROADMAP.md), resolve open questions first, spawn the Worker, review findings, spawn Auditor, approve/commit. Update the roadmap after every session.

**Research-First Principle:** Before implementing any fix, read the relevant docs and build a mental model with citations. If a second attempt fails for related reasons, stop coding and read. Named anti-patterns: address shopping, circular investigation, modern platform assumptions, undocumented guessing — all banned.

**Roadmap maintenance rule:** After any session, update `VR60_ROADMAP.md` (decisions, risks, lessons) and `analysis/agent-scratch/oracle/index.md` if new facts established.

## Build & Test

```bash
make all          # Build 4MB ROM from disassembly
make clean        # Remove build artifacts
picodrive build/vr_rebuild.32x  # Test in emulator (PicoDrive only — BlastEm has NO 32X support)
```

Build produces `build/vr_rebuild.32x`. Binary compatibility with the original ROM is no longer maintained — the codebase is now actively modified for optimization and correctness.

## Ground Rules — STRICTLY ENFORCED

1. **Do Not Guess** — Use `docs/` (hardware manuals) and `analysis/` (architecture). Use `analysis/agent-scratch/oracle/index.md` as a topic lookup table. Read the primary source. Research first.
2. **Understand Before Modifying** — Never patch `dc.w` without understanding it. Disassemble and document first.
3. **Use Available Tools** — Profiler at `tools/libretro-profiling/`, disassemblers `tools/m68k_disasm.py` and `tools/sh2_disasm.py`. Measure, don't assume.
4. **Proper Assembly** — Modify assembly source, not raw binary. Convert `dc.w` to mnemonics when possible (see [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for SH2 exceptions).
5. **Clean Commits** — No stale comments, no partial changes. Revert completely if something doesn't work.
6. **Verify Changes** — `make clean && make all` after every modification. Confirm build succeeds.
7. **DRY** — Never create duplicate files. Fix in place. Use git branches for experiments.
8. **COMM Register Safety** — Before modifying any 68K↔SH2 communication code, read [analysis/COMM_REGISTERS_HARDWARE_ANALYSIS.md](analysis/COMM_REGISTERS_HARDWARE_ANALYSIS.md). Critical rules:
   - **Read-during-write = undefined** — not just write-write. Both CPUs must use handshakes.
   - **SH2 writes are buffered** — value may not reach the register immediately. Dummy-read the same address to force synchronization.
   - **COMM1 is a system signal register** — func_084 manages COMM1_LO bit 0 ("command done"); V-INT, scene init, frame swap all poll it. Never write arbitrary data to COMM1 without save/restore + interrupt disable.
   - **COMM7 is the Slave doorbell** — never broadcast game command bytes to it (proven crash, B-006).
   - **Always use cache-through** (`$20004020`) for SH2 COMM access, never `$00004020`.
9. **Memory Boundaries** — Always check the [hardware manual memory map](docs/32x-hardware-manual.md) before assuming an address is accessible from another CPU.
   - **SH2 CANNOT access 68K Work RAM** (`$FF0000`) at ANY address. The region between SDRAM (`$0203FFFF`) and Frame Buffer (`$04000000`) is unmapped. Three failed B-003 attempts proved this.
   - **SDRAM mapping**: SH2 `$0600xxxx` = ROM file offset `$20000 + xxxx`, NOT `$xxxx`. Getting this wrong produces hex dumps of 68K code instead of SH2 SDRAM.
   - **Shared memory options** (exhaustive): COMM registers (16 bytes), SDRAM ($02000000-$0203FFFF), Frame Buffer ($04000000, FM-controlled). That's all.
10. **SH2 Patching Discipline** — SH2 code is tightly interconnected. Careless patches cause silent corruption.
    - **Literal pool sharing**: `MOV.L @(disp,PC),Rn` instructions share literal pools. Before overwriting ANY address in SH2 code, scan the entire section for `$Dnxx` opcodes that resolve to it (see [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) §SH2 Literal Pool Sharing).
    - **Test patches in isolation**: Interacting patches hide root causes. Never combine multiple SH2 patches without testing each one alone first (proven in B-006: reverting Patch #2 alone was insufficient).
    - **Verify encodings**: Always verify assembled SH2 opcodes against original ROM bytes with `python3`. Subtle encoding errors (wrong register field, wrong displacement) are invisible until runtime.
11. **COMM Offload Cost Model** — Synchronous COMM offload is **only viable when computation time >> handshake overhead × call count**. Each COMM round-trip costs ~200-500 68K cycles of polling + register I/O, and COMM0_HI is a global busy flag — every call waits for ALL prior COMM commands to finish. Small functions called frequently (e.g., `angle_normalize`: 8×/frame, ~1,500 cycles native) become **dramatically slower** under COMM dispatch (+23% total 68K time). For small functions, use batching (N inputs per COMM command) or async/pipelined approaches. See [OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md](OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md) §Key Lessons.

## Architecture

**Approach:** Full ROM rebuild from disassembly (NOT code injection).
**Workflow:** Edit sources in `disasm/sections/` or `disasm/modules/` → `make all` → test.

### ROM Layout

```
$000000-$2FFFFF  3.0 MB  Original game (68K + SH2)
$300000-$3FFFFF  1.0 MB  SH2 expansion space (~1.5KB used, 99.9% free)
```

### Build Pipeline

```
disasm/vrd.asm (entry point)
  → disasm/sections/*.asm (header + vectors + 12 code sections + data + SH2 + expansion)
    → disasm/modules/68k/*/*.asm (823 modules across 17 categories + 15 game subcategories)
    → disasm/sh2/generated/*.inc (89 SH2 function includes)
  → build/vr_rebuild.32x (4MB ROM)
```

### Key Stats

- **823 68K modules** (736 fully translated, 87 with remaining dc.w — all data, not code)
- **All SH2 functions** integrated (92 function IDs via 89 .inc files, zero remaining)
- **Display FPS**: ~40 (camera interpolation, stable frame pacing). Game logic at 20 FPS.
- **60 FPS blocker**: FS swap must happen during VBlank → need swap-only V-INT handler (R-002). Design ready, 4 table slots available. See [VINT_HANDLER_ARCHITECTURE.md](analysis/VINT_HANDLER_ARCHITECTURE.md) §6.
- **Master SH2 commands**: 7 active ($00-$06) — all disassembled. See [SH2_COMMAND_HANDLER_REFERENCE.md](analysis/sh2-analysis/SH2_COMMAND_HANDLER_REFERENCE.md)

### 68K Game Architecture

The game uses a **two-level dispatch** system. See [SCENE_HANDLER_ARCHITECTURE.md](analysis/SCENE_HANDLER_ARCHITECTURE.md) for full reference.

**Level 1 — Scene handler** (`$FF0002`): Self-modifying main loop at `$FF0000` calls `JSR [$FF0002]` each frame. Changing this pointer changes the game mode (loading, display init, racing, menus, etc.). Over 20 distinct handlers exist.

**Level 2 — State dispatcher** (`$C87E`): Within each scene handler, a sub-dispatcher reads `$C87E` (game state, increments by 4), indexes a jump table, and executes the appropriate state handler. Five race sub-dispatchers handle countdown, active racing, results, attract, and replay.

**V-INT state** (`$C87A` via `$FF0008`): Each state handler writes a V-INT state that controls which V-INT sub-handler runs during the next VBlank. 16+ entries in the jump table at `$0016B2`. State `$0054` = frame swap handler (checks COMM1_LO "done" signal, resets `$C87E`, toggles FS bit). See [VINT_HANDLER_ARCHITECTURE.md](analysis/VINT_HANDLER_ARCHITECTURE.md).

**$C8A8 command staging**: `mars_dma_xfer_vdp_fill` reads `$C8A8` and writes its bytes to COMM0 for SH2 dispatch. **C8A8 = $0102 for ALL per-frame DMA in ALL modes** (cmd $02 = scene orchestrator). Cmd $03 ($0103) is one-time init only — `race_scene_init_vdp_mode` sets it but falls through to `scene_init_orch` which overwrites to $0102.

### SH2 Architecture

**Dual independent dispatch** — Master and Slave have completely separate poll loops. See [SLAVE_SH2_DISPATCH_ARCHITECTURE.md](analysis/SLAVE_SH2_DISPATCH_ARCHITECTURE.md).

| CPU | Loop | Polls | Jump Table | Utilization | Role |
|-----|------|-------|-----------|-------------|------|
| Master | $06000460 | COMM0_HI | $06000780 (16 entries) | 0-36% | Command router + block copies |
| Slave | $06000592 | COMM2_HI | $060005C8 (8 entries) | ~73% | **ALL 3D rendering (bottleneck)** |

No direct cross-trigger. 68K submits to Master (COMM0) and Slave (COMM2) independently. COMM7 = async doorbell for cmd_27 pixel work (Slave polls in idle loop). COMM1_LO bit 0 = Master "done" signal.

**Dual rendering pipeline** (both on Slave):
- **Pipeline 1**: On-chip SRAM ($C0000000, 1748B). Self-contained, zero wait states. 36 entities/frame in 3 batches. **Untouchable.**
- **Pipeline 2**: SDRAM cache ($06003024 main_coordinator_short). coord_transform (12%), frustum_cull (12%), span_filler (8%). **Optimization target** — S-6 saved ~5%.

### Critical Constraint: Expansion ROM ($300000+)

- Executed by **SH2 only**, not 68K
- Must use `dc.w` format (raw SH2 opcodes), NEVER 68K mnemonics
- 68K machine code = invalid SH2 instructions = boot failure
- Implementation: [disasm/sections/expansion_300000.asm](disasm/sections/expansion_300000.asm)

### ROM Address Mapping

- **68000**: `cpu_addr = file_offset + 0x00880000`
- **SH2**: `cpu_addr = file_offset + 0x02000000`
