# Virtua Racing Deluxe (32X) — Full Disassembly & 60 FPS Optimization

**Status: 40 FPS achieved, 60 FPS one blocker away**

A complete, buildable disassembly of Virtua Racing Deluxe for the Sega 32X with deep architectural understanding of the game's internals — now actively optimized to push the hardware to its limits. The original game runs at ~20 FPS; this project has doubled that to 40 FPS via camera interpolation and is one hardware constraint away from 60 FPS.

> **Looking for the unmodified disassembly?** The byte-identical original code is preserved in the [`v5.0-freeze`](../../tree/v5.0-freeze) branch.

## Current State (March 2026)

```
Display FPS:  ~40  (camera interpolation, stable frame pacing)
Game logic:    20 FPS (unchanged — physics, AI, collision at original speed)
Next target:   60 FPS (1 hardware blocker remaining)

CPU Utilization (40 FPS, profiled):
  68000:       █████████░░░░░░░░░░░  48%   ← Idle 52% (STOP #$2300)
  Master SH2:  ██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  0-36% ← Command router + block copies
  Slave SH2:   ██████████████░░░░░░  73%   ← ALL 3D rendering (bottleneck)
```

### What's Working

- **40 FPS display** via camera interpolation — game logic at 20 FPS, display at 40 FPS by rendering 2 interpolated camera frames per game tick. Zero physics changes.
- **Complete architectural understanding** — 68K scene handlers, V-INT dispatch, dual SH2 dispatch, COMM protocol, rendering pipeline, all documented
- **SH2 coord_transform inlined** (S-6) — ~5% Slave reduction, 4 call sites relocated to expansion ROM
- **Command protocol optimized** (B-003/B-004/B-005) — 64% overhead reduction
- **823 68K modules** fully organized, 736 translated to mnemonics
- **All 92 SH2 functions** integrated and documented

### What's Next: 60 FPS

**One blocker remains:** Frame buffer swap (FS bit) writes outside VBlank are deferred by hardware. A swap-only V-INT handler (~30 bytes) is needed to perform FS toggles during VBlank for the interpolated frames. The V-INT dispatch table has 4 unused slots available. Design is ready in [VINT_HANDLER_ARCHITECTURE.md](analysis/VINT_HANDLER_ARCHITECTURE.md) §6.

## How It Works

### 68K Game Architecture

The game uses a **two-level dispatch** system:

1. **Scene handler** (`$FF0002`) — Self-modifying main loop calls a handler pointer each frame. Changing it switches game modes (loading, display init, racing, menus). Over 20 distinct handlers manage the full lifecycle from boot through racing to results.

2. **State dispatcher** (`$C87E`) — Within each scene handler, a sub-dispatcher indexes a jump table by game state. States advance by 4 each frame; state 8 runs the full game frame. The V-INT frame swap handler resets `$C87E` to 0 when the SH2 signals "render done" via COMM1.

3. **V-INT dispatch** (`$C87A`) — Each state handler writes a V-INT state that controls which VBlank handler runs. 16+ entries handle everything from minimal VDP reads to full frame buffer swaps with palette DMA.

### Dual SH2 Architecture

Master and Slave SH2 have **completely independent dispatch loops** polling different COMM registers:

| CPU | Polls | Role | Utilization |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|
| **Master** | COMM0_HI | Game commands: block copies, scene init, DMA | 0-36% |
| **Slave** | COMM2_HI | **ALL 3D rendering** via dual pipeline | ~73% |

No direct cross-trigger. The 68K submits to each independently. COMM7 is an async doorbell for pixel work.

**Slave rendering pipeline** (the bottleneck):
- **Pipeline 1:** On-chip SRAM ($C0000000, 1748 bytes). Self-contained, zero wait states, 36 entities/frame. Untouchable.
- **Pipeline 2:** SDRAM cache. coord_transform (12%), frustum_cull (12%), span_filler (8%). This is the optimization target.

### Camera Interpolation (A-1)

```
State 0 (TV1): Snapshot camera → DMA to SH2 → SH2 renders frame A
State 4 (TV2): Block-copy A → swap → interpolate camera → re-DMA → SH2 renders frame B
State 8 (TV3): Existing swap displays frame B
Result: 2 swaps / 3 TV frames = 40 FPS display, 20 FPS game logic
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the ROM
make all

# Test in emulator (PicoDrive only — BlastEm has no 32X support)
picodrive build/vr_rebuild.32x

# Profile (30 seconds, headless)
cd tools/libretro-profiling
./profiling_frontend ../../build/vr_rebuild.32x 1800 --autoplay

## ROM Layout

```
Address Range    Size      Contents
──────────────────────────────────────────
$000000-$2FFFFF  3.0 MB    Game Code (68K + SH2)
$300000-$3FFFFF  1.0 MB    SH2 Expansion Space (~2.5KB used, 99.8% free)
──────────────────────────────────────────
Total            4.0 MB    Full Cartridge
```

The expansion space contains optimized SH2 handlers: inlined coord_transform (S-6), single-shot command protocols (B-004/B-005), and async infrastructure.

## Key Architectural Findings

| Finding | Evidence | Impact |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Slave SH2 is the true bottleneck | 73% utilization, ~300K cycles/frame | All optimization must target Slave |
| 68K has 52% idle time | STOP #$2300, 48% active work | 68K is NOT the bottleneck anymore |
| Camera interpolation works | 40 FPS achieved (A-1, commit b6bd487) | Display FPS decoupled from game logic |
| $C8A8 = $0102 always (cmd $02) | Verified fall-through analysis | Per-frame DMA is always scene orchestrator |
| Entity descriptors unused during racing | 4 independent profiling tests (S-1d) | LOD culling at $0600C344 is a dead end |
| On-chip SRAM pipeline is untouchable | 1748B, zero external calls | Only Pipeline 2 (SDRAM) is optimizable |
| V-INT table has 4 unused slots | $0040, $0048, $004C, $0050 | Swap-only handler can use any of these |
| Master SH2 is underutilized | 0-36%, mostly idle | Available for vertex transform offload (S-8) |
